# This script is used to facilitate the concurrent (or parallel) execution of
# commands among several computers.  To do that, all the computers should share
# the home directory at the same mount point using nfs.  It is recommended (but
# not required) to use nis to administer users, specially if you plan to
# distribute the execution among several computers.

# To use it, first create the ~/.concurrent directory in the home directory, and
# then modify your scripts placing run_pull in front of the command you want to
# make concurrent.
