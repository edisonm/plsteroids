% May be this is slow, but it works:
resolve_calln(M:CallN, A:B) :-
    !,
    resolve_calln(CallN, Goal),
    strip_module(M:Goal, A, B).
resolve_calln(Meta, Goal) :-
    do_resolve_calln(Meta, Meta2), !,
    resolve_calln(Meta2, Goal).
resolve_calln(Goal, Goal).

do_resolve_calln(Meta, Meta2) :-
    Meta =.. [call, Call|Args],
    extend_args(Call, Args, Meta2).
