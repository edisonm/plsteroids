%% transpose(+Matrix, ?Transpose)
%
%  Transpose a list of lists of the same length.
%
%  Its implementation is more general than the one in library/clp/clpfd.pl,
%  since it allows to work with incomplete double lists, provided that the
%  transpose have sense. Example:
%
%  ==
%  ?- transpose([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10],[11,12],[13]], Ts).
%  Ts = [[1, 5, 9, 11, 13], [2, 6, 10, 12], [3, 7], [4, 8]].
