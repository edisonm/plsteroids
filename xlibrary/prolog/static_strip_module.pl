%!  static_strip_module(Call, ContextModule, Head, Module) is det.
%
%   Like strip_module/4, but assume as Module the ContextModule if Call is
%   uninstantiated. Note that this work even if T and M are vars, which 
%   make this different from strip_module(M:C, X, Y), when M and C are vars
%
static_strip_module(T, M, T, M) :-
    var(T), !.
static_strip_module(Module:RT, _, T, M) :- !,
    static_strip_module(RT, Module, T, M).
static_strip_module(T, M, T, M).
